# Landing-Page
This project is focused to cover all the basics that have been taught until now in this course. I have already done a similar project for the CRL course by Kevin Powell, so looking forward to complete this quite easily. 
Plan: First things first. Get the html boiler plate ready for the whole page before moving forward to CSS. 
Once the skeleton of the page is formed add the contents.
Now, its time to roll into CSS.
